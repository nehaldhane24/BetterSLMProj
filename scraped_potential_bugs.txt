The successful exploit of vulnerability results into BFD traffic drop and BFD session flaps which leads to Denial of Service (DoS) condition . 

Applicability:
DT is using affected software version. 

Risk:
Medium.

Summary:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found". Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)]. In order to handle this issue SUP bios daemon patch is to be generated for this and to make it available for these three releases 7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a) where the issue was seen. The purpose of this patch is to facilitate the line card bios upgrade on EORs, when upgrading software.

Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].

Issue may have a functional impact.

Trigger:
This issue is seen after unplug and re-plugging the SFP.

Impact:
In this issue, the GLC-TE port was not coming up on the device after unplug and re-plugging the SFP. When the GLC-TE SFP is removed, the internal port state machine handling goes to the incorrect AN PSM type. So when the GLC-TE is plugged in, the software will go to incorrect flow and caused the link down. This issue affects all N9K boards that support GLC-TE 1G ports

Workaround:
As a workaround, shut /no shut the port.

Further information:
Connect device to N9k with GLC-TE. keep the connection up first. And then unplug and replug the SFP on N9k side.The port will not coming up untill you shut /no shut the port on N9k side.

This issue has a functional impact.

When C2960X is connected to N9k with GLC-TE, the connection stays up first but later when SFP is unplugged and re-plugged on N9k side, the port will not come up until we shut /no shut the port on N9k side.

This issue is seen after unplug and replug the SFP.

As a workaround, shut /no shut the port.

This is an externally found issue with 1 service request. Issue is not fixed in target release throttle.

While "unidirectional send-only" command is configured and one TX fiber link is connected to corresponding port we can see that input and output rate is the same. With such configuration we should see only output rate and input rate should be 0.

no "unidirectional send-only" in Cu configuration. Hence excluding the bug.

This issue has a functional impact.

A data packet from FTD-A sent to FTD-B in L2 only VLAN dedicated for FTD cluster communication link (CCL) has invlaid L4 checksum (expected) is silently dropped in Sundown ASIC. Packet drop is observed due to this issue.

This issue is triggered when sending BAD L4 checksum packets.

As a workaround, upgrading to a fixed version would fix this issue.

This is an externally found issue with 1 service request. Issue is fixed in 9.3.8.

Issue may have a functional impact.

Trigger:
This issue is seen after unplug and re-plugging the SFP.

Impact:
In this issue, the GLC-TE port was not coming up on the device after unplug and re-plugging the SFP. When the GLC-TE SFP is removed, the internal port state machine handling goes to the incorrect AN PSM type. So when the GLC-TE is plugged in, the software will go to incorrect flow and caused the link down. This issue affects all N9K boards that support GLC-TE 1G ports

Workaround:
As a workaround, shut /no shut the port.

Further information:
Connect device to N9k with GLC-TE. keep the connection up first. And then unplug and replug the SFP on N9k side.The port will not coming up untill you shut /no shut the port on N9k side.

This issue has a functional impact.

When C2960X is connected to N9k with GLC-TE, the connection stays up first but later when SFP is unplugged and re-plugged on N9k side, the port will not come up until we shut /no shut the port on N9k side.

This issue is seen after unplug and replug the SFP.

As a workaround, shut /no shut the port.

This is an externally found issue with 1 service request. Issue is not fixed in target release throttle.

This issue has a functional impact.

A data packet from FTD-A sent to FTD-B in L2 only VLAN dedicated for FTD cluster communication link (CCL) has invlaid L4 checksum (expected) is silently dropped in Sundown ASIC. Packet drop is observed due to this issue.

This issue is triggered when sending BAD L4 checksum packets.

As a workaround, upgrading to a fixed version would fix this issue.

This is an externally found issue with 1 service request. Issue is fixed in 9.3.8.

Comments:
Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Summary:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found". Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)]. In order to handle this issue SUP bios daemon patch is to be generated for this and to make it available for these three releases 7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a) where the issue was seen. The purpose of this patch is to facilitate the line card bios upgrade on EORs, when upgrading software.

Impact
Impact Category:upgrade failure
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Workaround
Available:Yes
Avoidance:NA
Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Workaround Available:Yes
Workaround Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Issue may have a functional impact.

Trigger:
This issue is seen after unplug and re-plugging the SFP.

Impact:
In this issue, the GLC-TE port was not coming up on the device after unplug and re-plugging the SFP. When the GLC-TE SFP is removed, the internal port state machine handling goes to the incorrect AN PSM type. So when the GLC-TE is plugged in, the software will go to incorrect flow and caused the link down. This issue affects all N9K boards that support GLC-TE 1G ports

Workaround:
As a workaround, shut /no shut the port.

Further information:
Connect device to N9k with GLC-TE. keep the connection up first. And then unplug and replug the SFP on N9k side.The port will not coming up untill you shut /no shut the port on N9k side.

This issue has a functional impact.

When C2960X is connected to N9k with GLC-TE, the connection stays up first but later when SFP is unplugged and re-plugged on N9k side, the port will not come up until we shut /no shut the port on N9k side.

This issue is seen after unplug and replug the SFP.

As a workaround, shut /no shut the port.

This issue has a functional impact.

A data packet from FTD-A sent to FTD-B in L2 only VLAN dedicated for FTD cluster communication link (CCL) has invlaid L4 checksum (expected) is silently dropped in Sundown ASIC. Packet drop is observed due to this issue.

This issue is triggered when sending BAD L4 checksum packets.

As a workaround, upgrading to a fixed version would fix this issue.

This is an externally found issue with 1 service request. Issue is fixed in 9.3.8.

Comments:
Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Summary:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found". Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)]. In order to handle this issue SUP bios daemon patch is to be generated for this and to make it available for these three releases 7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a) where the issue was seen. The purpose of this patch is to facilitate the line card bios upgrade on EORs, when upgrading software.
CLI:NA

Impact
Impact Category:upgrade failure
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Workaround
Available:Yes
Avoidance:NA
Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Workaround Available:Yes
Workaround Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Comments:
Issue may have a functional impact.

Trigger:
This issue is seen after unplug and re-plugging the SFP.

Impact:
In this issue, the GLC-TE port was not coming up on the device after unplug and re-plugging the SFP. When the GLC-TE SFP is removed, the internal port state machine handling goes to the incorrect AN PSM type. So when the GLC-TE is plugged in, the software will go to incorrect flow and caused the link down. This issue affects all N9K boards that support GLC-TE 1G ports

Workaround:
As a workaround, shut /no shut the port.

Further information:
Connect device to N9k with GLC-TE. keep the connection up first. And then unplug and replug the SFP on N9k side.The port will not coming up untill you shut /no shut the port on N9k side.

Filed on: 03/03/2021

// Applicble only if customer has GLC-TE//

This issue has a functional impact.

When C2960X is connected to N9k with GLC-TE, the connection stays up first but later when SFP is unplugged and re-plugged on N9k side, the port will not come up until we shut /no shut the port on N9k side.

This issue is seen after unplug and replug the SFP.

As a workaround, shut /no shut the port.

This is an externally found issue with 1 service request. Issue is not fixed in target release throttle.

Note: Connect device to N9k with GLC-TE. keep the connection up first. And then unplug and replug the SFP on N9k side. The port will not coming up untill you shut /no shut the port on N9k side

When the GLC-TE SFP is removed, the internal port state machine handling goes to incorrect AN PSM type. So when the GLC-TE is plugged in, the SW will go to incorrect flow and caused link down. This issue affects all N9K boards that support GLC-TE 1G ports. The fix is if the xcvr is removed or disabled, it'll go to previous correct PSM type in port_enabled state , so when the GLC-TE is inserted again, it'll go to correct PSM type.

While "unidirectional send-only" command is configured and one TX fiber link is connected to corresponding port we can see that input and output rate is the same. With such configuration we should see only output rate and input rate should be 0.

No "unidirectional send-only" in Cu configuration. Hence excluding the bug.

This issue has a functional impact.

A data packet from FTD-A sent to FTD-B in L2 only VLAN dedicated for FTD cluster communication link (CCL) has invlaid L4 checksum (expected) is silently dropped in Sundown ASIC. Packet drop is observed due to this issue.

This issue is triggered when sending BAD L4 checksum packets.

As a workaround, upgrading to a fixed version would fix this issue.

This is an externally found issue with 1 service request. Issue is fixed in 9.3.8.

Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Summary:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found". Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)]. In order to handle this issue SUP bios daemon patch is to be generated for this and to make it available for these three releases 7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a) where the issue was seen.

Impact
Impact Category:upgrade failure
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Workaround
Available:Yes
Avoidance:NA
Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Workaround Available:Yes
Workaround Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Comments:
Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Summary:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found". Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)]. In order to handle this issue SUP bios daemon patch is to be generated for this and to make it available for these three releases 7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a) where the issue was seen. The purpose of this patch is to facilitate the line card bios upgrade on EORs, when upgrading software.
CLI:NA
Trigger:NA
Repro:NA
Impact
Impact Category:upgrade failure
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Workaround
Available:Yes
Avoidance:NA
Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Comments:
Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Workaround Available:Yes
Workaround Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Comments:
Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Summary:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found". Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)]. In order to handle this issue SUP bios daemon patch is to be generated for this and to make it available for these three releases 7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a) where the issue was seen. The purpose of this patch is to facilitate the line card bios upgrade on EORs, when upgrading software.

Impact
Impact Category:upgrade failure
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Workaround
Available:Yes
Avoidance:NA
Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Workaround Available:Yes
Workaround Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Issue may have a functional impact.

Trigger:
This issue is seen after unplug and re-plugging the SFP.

Impact:
In this issue, the GLC-TE port was not coming up on the device after unplug and re-plugging the SFP. When the GLC-TE SFP is removed, the internal port state machine handling goes to the incorrect AN PSM type. So when the GLC-TE is plugged in, the software will go to incorrect flow and caused the link down. This issue affects all N9K boards that support GLC-TE 1G ports

Workaround:
As a workaround, shut /no shut the port.

Further information:
Connect device to N9k with GLC-TE. keep the connection up first. And then unplug and replug the SFP on N9k side.The port will not coming up untill you shut /no shut the port on N9k side.

This issue has a functional impact.

When C2960X is connected to N9k with GLC-TE, the connection stays up first but later when SFP is unplugged and re-plugged on N9k side, the port will not come up until we shut /no shut the port on N9k side.

This issue is seen after unplug and replug the SFP.

As a workaround, shut /no shut the port.

This is an externally found issue with 1 service request. Issue is not fixed in target release throttle.

This issue has a functional impact.

A data packet from FTD-A sent to FTD-B in L2 only VLAN dedicated for FTD cluster communication link (CCL) has invlaid L4 checksum (expected) is silently dropped in Sundown ASIC. Packet drop is observed due to this issue.

This issue is triggered when sending BAD L4 checksum packets.

As a workaround, upgrading to a fixed version would fix this issue.

This is an externally found issue with 1 service request. Issue is fixed in 9.3.8.

Comments:
Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Summary:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found". Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)]. In order to handle this issue SUP bios daemon patch is to be generated for this and to make it available for these three releases 7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a) where the issue was seen. The purpose of this patch is to facilitate the line card bios upgrade on EORs, when upgrading software.
CLI:NA

Impact
Impact Category:upgrade failure
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Workaround
Available:Yes
Avoidance:NA
Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Workaround Available:Yes
Workaround Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Comments:
Issue may have a functional impact.

Trigger:
This issue is seen after unplug and re-plugging the SFP.

Impact:
In this issue, the GLC-TE port was not coming up on the device after unplug and re-plugging the SFP. When the GLC-TE SFP is removed, the internal port state machine handling goes to the incorrect AN PSM type. So when the GLC-TE is plugged in, the software will go to incorrect flow and caused the link down. This issue affects all N9K boards that support GLC-TE 1G ports

Workaround:
As a workaround, shut /no shut the port.

Further information:
Connect device to N9k with GLC-TE. keep the connection up first. And then unplug and replug the SFP on N9k side.The port will not coming up untill you shut /no shut the port on N9k side.

Filed on: 03/03/2021

// Applicble only if customer has GLC-TE//

This issue has a functional impact.

When C2960X is connected to N9k with GLC-TE, the connection stays up first but later when SFP is unplugged and re-plugged on N9k side, the port will not come up until we shut /no shut the port on N9k side.

This issue is seen after unplug and replug the SFP.

As a workaround, shut /no shut the port.

This is an externally found issue with 1 service request. Issue is not fixed in target release throttle.

Note: Connect device to N9k with GLC-TE. keep the connection up first. And then unplug and replug the SFP on N9k side. The port will not coming up untill you shut /no shut the port on N9k side

When the GLC-TE SFP is removed, the internal port state machine handling goes to incorrect AN PSM type. So when the GLC-TE is plugged in, the SW will go to incorrect flow and caused link down. This issue affects all N9K boards that support GLC-TE 1G ports. The fix is if the xcvr is removed or disabled, it'll go to previous correct PSM type in port_enabled state , so when the GLC-TE is inserted again, it'll go to correct PSM type.

While "unidirectional send-only" command is configured and one TX fiber link is connected to corresponding port we can see that input and output rate is the same. With such configuration we should see only output rate and input rate should be 0.

No "unidirectional send-only" in Cu configuration. Hence excluding the bug.

This issue has a functional impact.

A data packet from FTD-A sent to FTD-B in L2 only VLAN dedicated for FTD cluster communication link (CCL) has invlaid L4 checksum (expected) is silently dropped in Sundown ASIC. Packet drop is observed due to this issue.

This issue is triggered when sending BAD L4 checksum packets.

As a workaround, upgrading to a fixed version would fix this issue.

This is an externally found issue with 1 service request. Issue is fixed in 9.3.8.

Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Summary:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found". Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)]. In order to handle this issue SUP bios daemon patch is to be generated for this and to make it available for these three releases 7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a) where the issue was seen.

Impact
Impact Category:upgrade failure
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Workaround
Available:Yes
Avoidance:NA
Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Workaround Available:Yes
Workaround Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Comments:
Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Summary:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found". Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)]. In order to handle this issue SUP bios daemon patch is to be generated for this and to make it available for these three releases 7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a) where the issue was seen. The purpose of this patch is to facilitate the line card bios upgrade on EORs, when upgrading software.
CLI:NA
Trigger:NA

Impact
Impact Category:upgrade failure
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Workaround
Available:Yes
Avoidance:NA
Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Workaround Available:Yes
Workaround Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Comments:
Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Summary:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found". Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)]. In order to handle this issue SUP bios daemon patch is to be generated for this and to make it available for these three releases 7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a) where the issue was seen. The purpose of this patch is to facilitate the line card bios upgrade on EORs, when upgrading software.
CLI:NA
Trigger:NA
Repro:NA
Impact
Impact Category:upgrade failure
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Workaround
Available:Yes
Avoidance:NA
Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Comments:
Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Summary:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found". Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)]. In order to handle this issue SUP bios daemon patch is to be generated for this and to make it available for these three releases 7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a) where the issue was seen. The purpose of this patch is to facilitate the line card bios upgrade on EORs, when upgrading software.
CLI:NA
Trigger:NA
Repro:NA
Impact
Impact Category:upgrade failure
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Workaround
Available:Yes
Avoidance:NA
Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Workaround Available:Yes
Workaround Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Workaround Available:Yes

Comments:
Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Summary:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found". Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)]. In order to handle this issue SUP bios daemon patch is to be generated for this and to make it available for these three releases 7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a) where the issue was seen. The purpose of this patch is to facilitate the line card bios upgrade on EORs, when upgrading software.
CLI:NA
Trigger:NA

Impact
Impact Category:upgrade failure
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Workaround
Available:Yes
Avoidance:NA
Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload. When this happens, the patches are inconsistent between active and standby, and will need to be restored using the following commands:
->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Workaround Available:Yes
Workaround Recovery:As a workaround, install the patch using the instructions in the Release notes.

Comments:
Symptoms:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found".
Conditions:Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)].
Summary:It is observed that install all upgrade to dublin fails with error: "Bios Image not found". Issue is seen when the EOR chassis is running one of the following nxos versions [7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a)]. In order to handle this issue SUP bios daemon patch is to be generated for this and to make it available for these three releases 7.0(3)I1(2), 7.0(3)I1(3), 7.0(3)I1(3a) where the issue was seen. The purpose of this patch is to facilitate the line card bios upgrade on EORs, when upgrading software.

Impact
Impact Category:upgrade failure
Impact Description:When the patch is deactivated using "install deactivate <patch>" after "install activate <patch>" on a dual SUP, it has been observed to cause the Standby SUP to reload.

->install remove inactive
->install commit 
->reload
On the next reload, both the SUP will boot without the patch, so the patch will have to be added again following the above 3 step instructions to upgrade to 7.0(3)I3(1).

To begin with, interface has primary keychin & fallback key chain with should secure policy. Both key chains have one key each in them. Both keys don’t have match here.With this session is pending with PRIMARY-PSK which is expected.Now emptied the primary key chain by deleting the primary key. Expectation is to have session pending on FALLBACK-PSK which is not the case.After the reload or disable & enable macsec feature & then replay the macsec config, the session shows pending with FALLBACK-PSK.
